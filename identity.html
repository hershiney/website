      <p> At a glance, I look like an Asian woman.  A layer deeper, I am a Hmong American woman, trying to find my purpose and be at peace with myself.  I was born into two different worlds.  The Hmong world, filled with one-sided expectations, it's where I was taught the traditional ways of a Hmong woman; it's an environment where culturally it was difficult to have a decent conversation with my parents. The other world, filled with English, grammar and internalized oppression, is a place where I had to work harder, only able to rely on my continuous efforts and achievements.</p>

    <div id="identity_p2">
      <p> I lived and grew up in a small, rural town in Southwest Minnesota called, Walnut Grove.  At 16 years old, I learned to play volleyball and enjoyed it, so I was in a volleyball team.  It had been over a year, but all I ever did was play volleyball.  I never really learned or had the courage to talk and build relationships with the other girls; they’ve been playing volleyball together and known each other since grade school so I didn’t feel like I belonged.  I was more comfortable hanging out with my Hmong friends (although they weren’t apart of the volleyball team with me at that time).  That one night, we were supposed to have volleyball practice.  I was early, so I figured I would wait by the gym.  I remembered how everything felt, like it was just yesterday.  The gym was pitched black.  The hallway was quiet.  The school was empty.  While I was strolling around the school looking for someone, I found the janitor on duty that night in his office, and then he told me practice had been cancelled.  I was frustrated, thinking to myself why didn’t anyone tell me sooner?  I remembered earlier that week I had briefly saw some of my teammates.  Why didn’t they say anything about practice tonight?  My sister had already left after dropping me off, so I had to find a way to get home.  No one picked up my calls.  I had no choice but to feel upset.  I didn’t have any way to contact my teammates and coach (not that it mattered, but the thought of it made me realized how truly left out I felt).  After frantically and desperately looking for a way out as if the world  was ending, the janitor kindly offered to take me home.  As the janitor quietly drove me home, the usual 20-minute commute from school to home felt like forever.  During the ride, I secretly cried, hoping that I didn’t feel or look any more pathetic, especially in the company of a complete stranger.  I did not want to cry, but then trying hard not to cry made me cry even more.  I’ve never felt so alone in my life.  Questions flooded my head, and I wanted answers.  Why do I have to feel this way?  Why is this happening to me?  I know everything happened unintentionally; but for some reason, it sucked because I was still hurt even though no one intended to hurt me.  At that time, I didn’t have the courage to settle this uneasy feeling inside me, so I ended up internalizing it, like nothing happened.  I was a coward.  I wanted to forget everything so badly.  I felt stupid and blamed myself for letting something this small hurt me so much.  Now, I am haunted of being alone, having no connection with anyone, and feeling helpless even with the dependence of others.  I hope a day will come when I have healed and forgiven myself completely, loving myself to the fullest. </p>

      <p> Growing up in a rural small town in Southwest Minnesota, I wanted to change myself.  I didn’t like being Hmong.  I was aware that I always had to work harder than majority of my peers.  I took extra English courses because it was taking longer for me to learn than most kids.  I was teased of my Hmong accent and became ashamed of who I was born as.  I wanted to be smarter and better than my classmates because it was the only thing that made me feel important and good enough to my peers, teachers, and parents.  Living with my parents, there was always expectations set for me as a Hmong woman.  I could not go out late.  I couldn’t cut or dye my hair.  My dad would blame or yell at my mom if me or my sisters had makeup on or were showing too much skin.  I had specific chores to do that my brothers were never given.  I was told to focus more on my studies than my friendships and extracurricular activities.  And because my parents came to the States with nothing, they were poor and uneducated.  So, I had to start working as soon as I turned 16 to help out my parents, so I can also spoil myself with clothes and things from Walmart (which was the best and nearest shopping place available to us).  Whether I was at school or at my parent’s house, I was suffocating.  It became clearer to me that I cannot change who I was born as.  I just wanted to get out.  This lifestyle that I had put up with since the end of my high school years encouraged me to strive for extraordinary dreams, giving me hope that being different and wanting different things for myself was totally okay.  This freed me from how my parents wanted me to live as a Hmong woman.  I wanted to let go of the rural community that had made me feel so small.  I am a Hmong woman, and I know there’s so much more for me.</p>

      <p> As a Hmong woman, I am beautiful.  By that, I mean I feel beautiful with my own identity as a Hmong American woman.  I didn’t always feel beautiful at first, especially as a person of color.  Feeling beautiful didn’t come naturally to me.  I had to go through different trial and errors to really understand how and what makes me feel this way.  For me, feeling beautiful means having confidence in myself and how I present myself.  It means having at least some makeup on and dressing up.  I love the power of makeup and how I am able to transform dramatically.  This gives me an enhanced feeling different from when I have a bare face.  Having makeup on always brightens my day and gives me assurance that I will be okay.  I am also aware that everyone has their own way of feeling beautiful and will go through different phases of what beauty means to them.  However, this is how I define my beauty, which may change in the future–who knows?!  We are all human-beings with imperfections that sometimes may be hard to accept.  I think it is a powerful thing to say and believe in yourself that you are truly beautiful even if it means you have to dress up, be in comfortable clothes, put on some makeup, have some crazy hair style, or anything that others might not understand.  As I have stood my ground, I hope this also gives you some courage to start your path to feeling beautiful and confident in yourself.</p>

      <p>Exactly four years ago, I was miserable and felt so out of place as I was growing up in my rural hometown of Walnut Grove, MN.  I didn’t have the resources to identify or understand what it means to be a woman of color.  All the extracurricular activities I participated in was to ensure that I had something to relate and identify with, but they were never enough for me.  At the same time, I was fed up with how visible internalized oppression was within me, affecting how I negatively and inconsistently viewed myself and the people around me.  I could not understand what I really wanted for me, but I knew that the next chapter in my life was not anywhere near my hometown.  So, I left as soon as I could and started my college career at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities.  As a President’s Emerging Scholar, I received the resources to give me a better understanding of what it means for me to be a people of color.  I discovered and explored so many communities, such as Tsev Hmoob (Hmong House Living Learning Community), University YMCA, Asian-American Student Union, Lao Student Association, Vietnamese Student Association, Philippine Student Association, and Hmong Minnesota Student Association (HMSA).  With my transition from a general member to leadership roles in HMSA, my identity as a Hmong American woman blossomed even more through the understanding and discussion of social issues impacting my life, such as internalized oppression, racism, white supremacy, etc.  In the past four years of my life, I was also lucky enough to have seen so many women standing together and leading those who resonate with their voices.  The more I became educated about how my life experiences gave me a stance as a Hmong American woman, I felt empowered to someday give back and be a part of my community.  As I am starting to transition to a new chapter in my life, I want to continue building myself with hopes of eventually becoming an acknowledged voice for the importance of visual aesthetics and design aspects that are within the Hmong American and Asian-American communities.  I want to make an impact in how it can enhance the power of communication for all voices that I resonate with. </p>
