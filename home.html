			<p>After the Vietnam War (aka the Secret War), a total of 41,000 Hmong refugees immigrated to America between 1976-1978.  During the following years up to the 2000s, thousands more were evacuated to the States where Hmong communities scattered throughout.  Today, the biggest Hmong community by the city resides in St. Paul, MN, making it a place to experience the richest culture of the Hmong people.</p>

			<p>Dating back to older times, Hmong people lived in various villages of Southeast Asia and China and still do.  Depending on the demographics and location of where Hmong people settled, they formed dialects and lifestyles slightly differing from villages in China to villages in Laos.  At the same time, the vast majority throughout the world has similar spiritual beliefs and traditional practices as well as some understanding of the Hmong language.  The Hmong people have grown to form many types of groups, such as Hmoob Dawj (White Hmong), Hmoob Ntsuab (Green Hmong), Hmoob Dub (Black Hmong), Hmoob Txaij (Striped Hmong), and many more. </p>

			<p>As the Hmong people assimilated into American culture, they are becoming more educated about the modern world along with the struggles of fitting into society as a Hmong American. Hmong elders and immigrants are challenged to a changed lifestyle and environment. Meanwhile, the newer generation have been challenging and evolving traditional perspectives on topics relating to: gender roles, LGBTQIA, patriarchy, and mental health seen within the Hmong community. As a marginalized people, Hmong Americans continue to face and battle issues within the American society as well, such as internalized oppression, racism, prejudice, microaggressions, and white supremcy.  </p>
