			<p> Within the broader Asian-American population in America, Hmong Americans have been vibrantly sustaining its culture and roots in the Twin Cities Metro Area of Minnesota.  As a group of people, they have faced many hardships, fighting for their own human rights.  Inspired from places they have once called home, Hmong Americans have established a way of living and blended other cultures with their own.  Being Hmong is similar to like how America is the “melting pot” of the world.  In other words, the Hmong people have been culturally assimilating themselves as they migrate and continue to live in many different countries.  They are a diverse, complex yet beautiful group of people.  And so every person has their own story and experience that continues to build the Hmong American foundation.
				<br><br>
			This space is intended for learning purposes only, to understand what it means to be a Hmong American from a few of many perspectives and stories. However, the stories that build the Hmong American culture and experience as a whole do not end here. For more stories, I encourage you to explore the Hmong Minnesota Student Association's Peb Lub Tsev and the Coalition of Asian American Leaders' #MinneAsianStories.</p>
